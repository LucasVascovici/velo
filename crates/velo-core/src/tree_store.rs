//! How stored trees are read.
//!
//! This is the only module allowed to name the `file_map` table (a lint
//! enforcing that lands with 20.2-d). Every function here is stated in tree
//! terms (a snapshot id in, paths and entries out) and never in rows, so the
//! storage underneath can change shape without any caller noticing. They are
//! plain functions over a connection on purpose: there is exactly one storage
//! layout at a time, so a trait would only be indirection.
//!
//! This part covers the single-snapshot reads. A snapshot that has no stored
//! tree reads as an empty tree; whether the snapshot exists is for the caller
//! to check against `snapshots`.
